//*     Modify PROCLIB member SCRTTOOL to reflect the PARMLIB       *  FILE 1022
//*     dataset name.                                               *  FILE 1022

//*   - Check and/or modify PARMLIB member SCRTJAVA for the JAVA    *  FILE 1022
//*     home directory /usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64 is what I use.         *  FILE 1022

//*   - Create a mount point directory in your zfs file system, I   *  FILE 1022
//*     use /SCRTTOOL/.  If you change it modify PARMLIB member     *  FILE 1022
//*     SCRTJAVA to reflect your location.                          *  FILE 1022

//*   - Create a zfs file for the SCRTTOOL directory. This makes    *  FILE 1022
//*     it easier when upgrading systems and maintenance.  I've     *  FILE 1022
//*     provided JCL SCRTZFS to create zfs file.  Mount this zfs    *  FILE 1022
//*     file to the directory above.  I've provided a member        *  FILE 1022
//*     ZFSMOUNT to place into your BPXPRMFS PARMLIB member so      *  FILE 1022
//*     it'll get mounted on all IPL's.                             *  FILE 1022

//*   - Create a new directory /SCRTTOOL/scrtv###, ### being the    *  FILE 1022
//*     SCRTTOOL version.  This is where you place the IBM JAR      *  FILE 1022
//*     file.  I create a new directory for every new version.  As  *  FILE 1022
//*     of this writing scrtv281 is the current release you will    *  FILE 1022
//*     need to modify the PARMLIB member SCRTJAVA to reflect the   *  FILE 1022
//*     new directory.                                              *  FILE 1022

//*   - I've provided PARMLIB member SCRTNO89.  You should use      *  FILE 1022
//*     your copy or the latest one from IBM and modify it.         *  FILE 1022
//*                                                                 *  FILE 1022

//*   - Modify PARMLIB member SCRTMAIL to reflect the contact name  *  FILE 1022
//*     email address reflected in PARMLIB member SCRTPARM.         *  FILE 1022
//*                                                                 *  FILE 1022
//*   - I've provided PARMLIB member SPECIAL.  You should use       *  FILE 1022
//*     your copy or the latest one from IBM and modify it.         *  FILE 1022

//*   - I've provided member DEFGDG to define a GDG for the SCRT    *  FILE 1022
//*     report files.  I use the maximum amount 255 as it's a small *  FILE 1022
//*     1 track dataset.  If you change the name you'll have to     *  FILE 1022
//*     change both the PROCLIB member SCRTTOOL and the PARMLIB     *  FILE 1022
//*     member SCRTMAIL.                                            *  FILE 1022

//*   - I mod the entire month of SMF data to one file in a prior   *  FILE 1022
//*     job not here.  This report uses the second day of the month *  FILE 1022
//*     through the first day of the month.  You'll note the two    *  FILE 1022
//*     files, one monthly and one daily for each of the two        *  FILE 1022
//*     systems in PROCLIB member SCRTTOOL as input.                *  FILE 1022
